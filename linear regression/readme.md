# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.

A basic linear regression plot looks like this: <img src="linear_regg.png">

Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.

### Hypothesis

where:  
**x: input training data**  
**y: labels to data**  
**θ1: intercept**  
**θ2: coefficient of x**  

Once we find the best θ1 and θ2 values, we get the best fit line. So when we are finally using our model for prediction, it will predict the value of y for the input value of x.
